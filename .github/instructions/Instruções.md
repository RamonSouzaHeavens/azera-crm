Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- Prioritize clarity and maintainability in code.
- Follow established coding conventions and best practices.
- Include comments and documentation where necessary.
- Ensure code is well-structured and modular.
- Write tests to cover new features and bug fixes.
- Keep security considerations in mind.
- Optimize for performance where applicable.
- Não pergunte se quero implementar as soluções, apenas implemente sem perguntar.
- Em vez de: "cd "e:\Agência\Gold Age\Heavens Enterprise\Azera" && npm run dev", use apenas "npm run dev"
